# Covid-19 Time-based Map Projection
The goal of this project is to provide an overview of the spread of Covid-19 and a projection of its predicted case counts in the form of a interpolated heat map. 

### TODO
- [ ] Implement API calls for current data
- [ ] Projections/history may need to be implemented as a separate map
